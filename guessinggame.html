			<h2 style ="color:Red"><i>How Does My Game Work You Might Ask?</i></h2>
					<p>The games starts with the prompt asking the player to take a stab at how the number of concerts I, the gamemaker, have attended in 2015. If the player is incorrect, the player will be asked to choose again. The player has 4 chances to choose the correct amount of concerts. Don't fret young padawin, there are several hints that are displayed after every wrong answer. These prompts will let you know if you are guessing too high or too low. So now that you know the rules, are you a terrible friend or are you a <b>STALKER?</b>
