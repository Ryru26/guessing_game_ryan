Guessing game created as a first assignment for Code Fellows

  The game is a guessing game centered around how many concerts I have attended in the current year. If the user answeres incorrectly, they are sent an alert that states "They are not my friend!". If the user correctly guesses the number of concerts I have attended they are answered with a message "You must have gone to the show with me!". This all possible using the guess, answer, and message prompts.  Starting with the guess, I add in the question "Can you guess how many concerts I have attended in 2015?". The correct answer is 3. From there my if/else questions are prompted based on the answer given they are sent an alert message.
