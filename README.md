Guessing game created as a first assignment for Code Fellows

  The game is a guessing game centered around how many concerts I have attended in the current year. If the user answeres incorrectly, they are given three more chances to answer correctly.  This all possible using a while loop too ask the user to guess until either they get it right or their number of tries is exhuasted.  Starting with the guess, I add in the question "Can you guess how many concerts I have attended in 2015?". The correct answer is 3.
